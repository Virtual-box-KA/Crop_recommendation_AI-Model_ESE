# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Classification Techniques

## 📌 Project Overview

In the age of precision agriculture, making data-driven decisions is crucial for optimizing crop yield and improving sustainability. This project presents an AI-based **Crop Recommendation System** that suggests the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions. Using a classification model trained on real-world data collected from Indian agricultural sources, this system assists farmers in making informed farming decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a dataset compiled from multiple sources including:
- Rainfall statistics
- Climate data
- Fertilizer information

The dataset includes the following features:
- **N**: Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
- **P**: Ratio of Phosphorus content in soil
- **K**: Ratio of Potassium content in soil
- **Temperature**: In degree Celsius
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity in %
- **pH**: pH value of the soil
- **Rainfall**: Rainfall in mm
- **Label**: Target crop to be recommended (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, etc.)
